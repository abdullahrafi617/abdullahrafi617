 - 👋 Hi, I’m @abdullahrafi617
- 👀 I’m interested in anything to do with Cybersecurity - specifically getting into Cybersecurity, the current skills shortage in the UK, and cloud security based on predominantly Microsoft environment.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Azure in depth. I am taking the AZ-104 at the moment, with a focus on learning how Azure works, the tools and capabilties it provides and how I would implement better security for companies. I believe I need to understand what I will be defending!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects such as home lab setups, Azure setups for practice, and CTFs.
- 📫 How to reach me - You can reach me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdullah-awais-rafi-43525b254/
- ⚡ Fun fact: I take F1 seriously enough to own a racing wheel and run league races bi-weekly.
